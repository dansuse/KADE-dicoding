## There are two branches in this repository
+ **master** branch which contains Final Project and Quiz

+ Using Anko-Commons, especially intent-builder feature which makes composing intent really concise
+ Kotlin Android Extensions
+ Android KTX
+ Anko-SQLite
+ Unit Testing with JUnit
+ UI Testing with Espresso
