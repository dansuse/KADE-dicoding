            "strDescriptionEN": "Fulham Football Club is a professional association football club based in Fulham, Greater London, England. Founded in 1879, they play in the Championship, having been relegated from the Premier League in 2013–14 after 13 consecutive seasons in the top-flight. They are the oldest-established football team from London to have played in the Premier League. After selling their top striker, Ross McCormack, and allowing Moussa Dembele to go on a free to Celtic, all hope of promotion back to the heights of the premier league were lost. Recently, they lost 2-1 to their rivals QPR (Queens Park Rangers) at home, the first time in 36 years that had happened. \r\n\r\nThe club has spent 25 seasons in English football's top division, the majority of these in two spells during the 1960s and 2000s. The latter spell was associated with former chairman Mohamed Al-Fayed, after the club had climbed up from the fourth tier in the 1990s. Fulham have never won a major honour, although they have reached two major finals: in 1975, as a Second Division team, they contested the FA Cup Final for the only time in their history, losing 2–0 to West Ham United, and in 2010 they reached the final of the UEFA Europa League, which they contested with Atlético Madrid in Hamburg, losing 2–1 after extra time.\r\n\r\nThe club has produced many English greats, including Johnny Haynes, George Cohen, Bobby Robson, Rodney Marsh and Alan Mullery. They play at Craven Cottage, a ground on the banks of the River Thames in Fulham which has been their home since 1896. Fulham's training ground is located near Motspur Park, where the club's Academy is also situated.",
